# Unity-3D-game-prototype-
The goal of this repository is to set up the basic gameplay for this prototype. The character, background, and obstacle of choice will be set up. The player will be able to press spacebar and make the character jump, as obstacles spawn at the edge of the screen and block the playerâ€™s path.
The starter files are extracted from the Unity Junior programmer create with code-2 Unit-3, from Unity.learn.com
